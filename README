CoW Tremulous QVM v2.0 [incomplete] merge with GPP-1.1/Lolards v0.7 mod

Credits for bots:
The original works of vcxzet (lamebot3) were used a guide to create TremBot.
The works of Amine Haddad (TremBot) and Sex (PBot) where used/modified to create COW Bot

From CoW bot code by Fuma (not up-to-date):
{
 Current Features (Over Lakitu QVM 5.5):
 Advanced bots with route finding capabilities and waypoint support. Entirely customisable!
 !loadlayout allows loading of a new layout without a restart
 !loadrotation allows the changing of rotations on demand
 !strip and associated commands allow admins to control a player's access to weapons/armor/classes. 
 
 Bot Specific Features:
 !botcfg allows loading/saving of bot configuration files
 !botset allows the changing of bot abilities
 !botcmd changes the bots behavior
 !bot adds bots with a specified skill level
 !drawnodes shows the waypoints
 /node allows the making of waypoints for the bots  

 Bots can:
 Go to a medistat to heal
 Go to an armoury to buy weapons and armor
 Evolve
 Use secondary abilities like lighting, pounce, snipe, charge
 Wallcrawl
 Use waypoints to navigate the map and go to a location
 Dodge.
 Will not keep human players in a long spawn queue
 Anti-Hax-type aiming using recoil system depending on skill level
}
Great thanks to Fuma for helping me with setting up a github account and helping me with the code
See his source code @ https://github.com/cmf028/CoW-Tremulous
FYI his version number needs to increment to 3.0. Don't get the wrong idea that i've upgraded to the new one.

Also, thanks /dev/humancontroller for debugging.

==Bot edits by me==
-Goon pounces TO human, not ABOVE human. (pitch was *10, now *6)
-Bot Lcannon charges 2.7 rather than original 2
-now buys lockblob launcher [see below] and possibly basi-suit* TODO (make a variable g_bot_basisuit)
-Bots now don't sit in the same spot when killing a structure

GPP-1.1 "Features":
-Smooth Regeneration
-Regen speeds depend upon your location
-Rant can "lawn mow" but has beenn nerfed by lots, and does 20% damage to buildables only
-Pounce whoring possible, but has been balanced with chomps
-

Imported from Lolards/Misc:
-Modified Turret aiming code
-Humans regenerate slowly
-Blaster/Flamer jumping is possible now

CoW Tremulous QVM v2.0 [incomplete] merge with GPP-1.1/Lolards v0.7 mod

Credits for bots:
The original works of vcxzet (lamebot3) were used a guide to create TremBot.
The works of Amine Haddad (TremBot) and Sex (PBot) where used/modified to create COW Bot

From CoW bot code by Fuma (not up-to-date):
{
 Current Features (Over Lakitu QVM 5.5):
 Advanced bots with route finding capabilities and waypoint support. Entirely customisable!
 !loadlayout allows loading of a new layout without a restart
 !loadrotation allows the changing of rotations on demand
 !strip and associated commands allow admins to control a player's access to weapons/armor/classes. 
 
 Bot Specific Features:
 !botcfg allows loading/saving of bot configuration files
 !botset allows the changing of bot abilities
 !botcmd changes the bots behavior
 !bot adds bots with a specified skill level
 !drawnodes shows the waypoints
 /node allows the making of waypoints for the bots  

 Bots can:
 Go to a medistat to heal
 Go to an armoury to buy weapons and armor
 Evolve
 Use secondary abilities like lighting, pounce, snipe, charge
 Wallcrawl
 Use waypoints to navigate the map and go to a location
 Dodge.
 Will not keep human players in a long spawn queue
 Anti-Hax-type aiming using recoil system depending on skill level
}
Great thanks to Fuma for helping me with setting up a github account and helping me with the code
See his source code @ https://github.com/cmf028/CoW-Tremulous
FYI his version number needs to increment to 3.0. Don't get the wrong idea that i've upgraded to the new one.

Also, thanks /dev/humancontroller for debugging and Volt for helping me start modding in the early days with his tutorial pack.

==Bot configuration edits by me==
-Goon pounces TO human, not ABOVE human.
-Bot Lcannon charges 2.5s rather than original 2
-Bots now don't sit in the same spot when killing a structure
-Maras aren't so bloody overpowered
-

GPP-1.1 Gameplay "Features":
-Smooth Regeneration
-Regen speeds depend upon your location
-Rant can "lawn mow" but has beenn nerfed by lots, and does 20% damage to buildables only
-Pounce whoring possible, but has been balanced with chomps
-Re-gassing as a basilisk resets the victim's disorientation timer rather than doing nothing and waiting for it to finish before becomming effective
-Gas goes through armour
-Gas deals a mere 1 damage per second
-Lcannon is a 1.1-Unvanquished mix (Dynamic luci ball speed from Lolards, 2.5 second primary charge time, gpp-like secondary or finish-off combos)
-Most buildables take gpp values
-Turrets are a mix - Crappy at close range againts a fast alien, but great in damage dealing and fires inaccurately (misses dretches a lot long range)
-DCC simply boosts turret aiming speeds and distribute defences (like 1.1 ) but aren't required for tesla generators
-No dcc required, but human buildables regenerate slowly (~2hp/s for most) rather than gpp's 4hp/s/dcc_in_range
-Painsaw range 60, not 40, not 80 so it is able to reach under feet without being overpowered, uses 1.1 damage/s
-GPP Pulse rifle projectile speed, 1.1 clip system
-Unvanquished-like stamina system, but still slow below 50%
-Other shit

Imported Gameplay from Lolards/Misc:
-Modified Turret aiming code
-Humans regenerate slowly
-Blaster/Flamer jumping is possible now
-Blaster Melee
-Dynamic luci ball speed
-Smoother flamer firing speed (10 damage per missile instead of 20, fires twice as fast, twice the ammo)
-Shotgun's mid-range accurate secondary (which stuns the user a bit as a side effect)
-Chaingun has a more inaccurate secondary which splits the bullets into three
-Chaingun has an extra clip
-Lasgun isn't 100% accurate, although still is very accurate
-Non-crappy JETPACK
-Higher falls now can insta-kill all armours
-Other shit

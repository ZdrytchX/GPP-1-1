There are some example paths what I was created and using.
You can create your owns with the command /node. 


Warning: in Linux using gamex86.so it is case sensitive so if you call: !map UnCreation
it will not get the path "uncreation" instead it will use a new one called "UnCreation".

You are advised!

**More paths added by ViruS**
*"most" uncompleted paths removed
*removed broken mission maps e.g. ztremship_b1, mission one b7 and rush_human_a2
*removed pointless ones like jump_a4
*removed personal map zstreetclash_b2 because it was never completed anyway
*left some sensible half-completed ones like bcs and city_overun-b1 (note the spelling error! I purpously spelt it this way because the map name is like that)
*updated some broken paths like some tremship's and utcs (tyrants get stuck, they might still though) and some others which i can't remember

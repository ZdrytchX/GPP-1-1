ProMode Background Info:

Challenge ProMode Arena is a Quake 3 Arena mod that involves weapon balance and physics modifications
such as doublejump and air control. CPMA was greatly loved by Quake 3:A fans and its physics has been
implemented into games such as WarSow and Xonotic. ZdrytchX (ViruS in-game) has implemented the physics
from the above URL to add ProMode physics to this mod, GPP-1.1 Arena.

                         CPM Physics Controls:
  Forward/Back gives "air control", which basically turns your character for you without losing speed.
  Strafe Left/Right gives the ability to stop in mid air quickly, and allows you to turn tight corners
      (However unlike air control you have to turn smoothly, and not too quick else you lose speed fast)
  Diagonal Strafe + Forward/Back is basically normal controls, they're kept this way so you can strafe
      jump without losing speed.

*************************Pre-Made Physics Modes:*************************

These settings that I provide for you fps (fast-paced-shooter, not that CoD crap) geeks out there, I made
some settings that simulate other game physics. Most of them are accurate, but the bunnyhop acceleration
amongst some other minorities hasn't had their algorithm checked so they aren't perfect. However the values
provided are mostly true, as some arrive from the Xonotic *official* configs that were provided with
Xonotic v0.6.

ProMode [Q3]  - "the old" 2001 CPMA original settings (The "new" CPM source has never been released at
  the point this was written). It is also known as CPMA, or Challenge ProMode Arena. The cliptime is
  unconfirmed, but I feel that it equates to the double jump timer.
  
Vanilla Trem [ioQ3]- Normal Tremulous of course. The '400 wishspeed' is actually just means it'll
  accelerate up to 400 ups if possible for the class. I increased to 500 because dretch uses 448.
  The actual cliptime for VQ3 physics is 250 but it appears to be patched out of tremulous.

ProTrem^ - my own personal setting. A.K.A. GPP-1.1 Arena's default. The reason why I chose to have
  a smaller cliptime is because marauder already has its own cliptime of 200 msec. It'll be hard
  to get used to both 400 and 200 msec at once.

TF2 [Source] - Simulates settings in Team Fortress 2 as of 2013 (Not all of which are actual values,
  but some are true. Note that hammer units are slightly different (x1.25?).
  
TFC [GoldSrc] - Simulates settings in Team Fortress Classic (Not actual values, just estimates)

Xonotic*^ [DarkPlaces] - Simulates settings for Xonotic. Xonotic is a community-driven mod that used to
  support Nexuiz until they went commercial. They have fantastic graphics although choppy animations
  and inaccurate client game predictions (Q1 online didn't have cgame prediction).
  There's one thing I won't duplicate here by the way, and that's the anti-strafe acceleration part
  (You can't strafe jump past the bhop limit)
  Xonotic 0.7 just has a speed limit of 900 instead of 800 AFAIK.
  
WarSow*^ [???]  - Not Sure, but it's from a Q2 mod. Gameplay is pretty much CPM with a dodge/dash key
  (similar to gpp's except you can dash forward and wallhop with it), a really strong air control
  (however with a STRONG speed penalty* for turning too quickly or using it at a wide angle) and a
  fantastic "noodle" lightning gun which they trashed out with the ammo strengths system. :'/
  WarSow's famous for their cartoon graphics AFAIK.
  I actually got the WarSow config data from Xonotic's pre-made settings that simulate WarSow physics.
  Note that the cliptime for WarSow is only for bunnyhopping up stairs judging from sound repeat rates.
  Doesn't apply for walls. It may actually not be an actual velocity clip because WarSow already has bhop
  so just put this as 0 when setting up WarSow settings. The settings provided were insufficent, and only
  provided data about its air control settings.
  WarSow's bunnyhop-up-stairs is weird; it only jumps once every 0.4 seconds (double jump time)
  and only applies if you're bhopping. It also allows you to "slide" off stairs like the ramp slide thing.
  And so my implemention of the weird bunnyhop isn't perfect, but it works to some extent. You may find
  yourself sliding off stair-case-like pillars, if they even exist.
  WarSow's forward bunnyhop apparently has a penalty when you're above the limit and slows you down unless
  you don't press 'forward' in air. I'll just ignore this feature for now.
  
Newbie's Physics^ - Just another one of my personal settings, comes with all-directional super strong air
  control, in other words you can pretty much make a fake WarSow dash in air with this since there's no
  air control penalty if you do it right. Comes with a strong bunnyhop up to 3000 ups because you can't
  strafe jump.

QuakeWorld& [Q1, slightly modded] - Quake 1 physics, QuakeWorld style. No step-up in mid air, but
  QuakeWorld's modified physics allows ramp jumping and ramp sliding. Identical to TFC's physics,
  without the speed limit, and has air (strafe) acceleration of 150. Apparently doesn't allow
  step-ups in air.
  There's also a weird issue with Quake 1 where people reckon there's a similar speed limit to
  TFC's but I haven't confirmed it myself.

Quake 2: I'm still new to Quake 2, so I haven't throughly analysed it yet. Apparently it's almost identicle
  to Quake 3, and id even left some evidence of it.

Quake 3: (Team)Arena [VQ3] - Same as 1.1 physics pretty much, only that it had a cliptime of 250 msec.

*TODO: Air Control Penalty (Makes the player slow down if they turn too fast
^TODO: Fix Bunnyhop Acceleration, it seems to bug people outside of the map from extreme acceleration
      that appears out of nowhere.
&Note: QW doesn't have Step-Ups in mid-air. I honestly don't like it, so I might not just not add it.
      I'm actually not sure if TF:C has this missing feature too, because I never played it.
